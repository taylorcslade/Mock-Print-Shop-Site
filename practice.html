        This shop is a way for me to combine two of my <em>favorite</em> things to do:
        traveling and photography. </h2>
        <h3>I have travelled to some beautiful places and taking
        pictures is a way for me to remember the beauty of where I once was. All of these
        prints are photos taken by me with love, and adoration for the world around me! I
        hope you enjoy these prints and have a piece of international heaven in your home.</h3>
